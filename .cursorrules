# Chain fo thought
- Before beginning, think if a specific package exist that will be easier than reimplementing existing code

# Blog Post Guidelines
- Each blog post should be in its own directory under src/app/blog/
- Use the BlogPost component for consistent styling
- Follow the heading hierarchy (h1 for title, h2 for sections, h3 for subsections)
- Use appropriate semantic HTML elements (blockquote, ul/li, em, strong)
- Maintain dark/light theme compatibility
- Include a date for each post
- Keep paragraphs concise and focused
- Use lists for enumerated points
- Include proper spacing between sections

# Coding rules
Prefer to use constants that are defined on the beginning of the function rather than inline constants
Prefer readability and simple code over all else
